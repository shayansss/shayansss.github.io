## About me
I am a [PhD student in Computer Science](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/computer-science/phd-computer-science/phd-students/phd/42428-seyed-shayan-sajjadinia){:target="_blank"} at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, supervised by [Prof. Bruno Carpentieri](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/computer-science/academic-staff/person/38064-bruno-carpentieri){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Gerhard A. Holzapfel](https://www.biomech.tugraz.at/){:target="_blank"}. I am also a mechanical engineer and a biomedical engineer, allowing me to carry out research on the interdisciplinary areas between these fields, especially using numerical analysis and artificial intelligence that have wide applications in engineering and medicine, e.g., computer simulation, computational biomechanics, medical imaging. In this regard, on the one hand, I implement finite element methods for physics-based and numerical modeling (typically by continuum mechanics and multiphysics), and on the other hand, I deploy machine learning methods for data-driven or intelligent modeling. I believe, although these techniques are great per se, combining them can be revolutionary, as they can address each otherâ€™s limitations. Therefore, most of my recent academic research and education are devoted to them separately and their combinations.
