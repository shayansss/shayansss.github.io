## About me
I am a [PhD student at Free University of Bozen-Bolzano](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/computer-science/phd-computer-science/phd-students/phd/42428-seyed-shayan-sajjadinia){:target="_blank"} , supervised by [Prof. Bruno Carpentieri](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/computer-science/academic-staff/person/38064-bruno-carpentieri){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Gerhard A. Holzapfel](https://www.biomech.tugraz.at/){:target="_blank"}. I am also a mechanical engineer and a biomedical engineer, allowing me to carry out research on applications of computer science on these fields.

Applied computer science, especially using numerical analysis and artificial intelligence, have wide applications in engineering and medicine, e.g., computer simulation, computational biomechanics, medical imaging. In particular, I am interested in finite element methods for physics-based and numerical modeling (typically by continuum mechanics and multiphysics. I also prefer machine learning methods for data-driven or intelligent modeling. I believe, although these two techniques are great per se, but combination of them can be revolutionary, as they can address each other's limitations. Therefore, I devote my recent academic research and education to the applications of machine learning and finite element analysis.

*[computer simulation]: It referes to the simulation of the natural systems and processes using mathematical methods implemented by computers, typically by numerical methods and data-driven algorithms.
*[computational biomechanics]: Computational or numerical biomechanics is an emerging field of natural science that first assumes that biological systems have significant mechanical behaviors and then uses computational mutiphysics and mechanical engineering methods, e.g., computer-aided engineering codes and continuum biomechanics, to computationally simulate them. It has many applications in medicine, e.g., optimization of orthopedic implants, cardiovascular multiphysics studies, virtual-reality-based surgical simulators, etc.
*[Medical imaging]: Medical image computing uses computer science (and related fields) to analyse the medical images. Depending on the imaging technique, it may be also relevant to physics, computational science, radiology, etc., rendering it a highly interdisciplinary area.
*[finite element methods]: These are a group of numerical methods to solve partial differntial equations, and they are highly used for computer simulation of (bio)mechanical processes.
*[multiphysics]: Multiphysics modeling focuses on coupling between different physical systems of equations, e.g., mechanochemical analysis, mixture theory, etc.
*[continuum mechanics]: It is an extremely widely-used method for physics-based modeling that uses applied mechanics, e.g., non-linear elasticity and fluid dynamics, to analytically model the mechanical (and similar) systems, with an assumption that the modeled systems are formed by continuous media. This assumption holds valid for most of engineering calculations, and even on discrete media, it may still be applicable if it can roughtly be viewed as continous at some scales.
*[machine learning]: it is a subfield of artificial intelligence that automatically uses data and experience to implement a computational task. It is also widely used for data analysis and data-driven modeling, especially using deep neural networks.
