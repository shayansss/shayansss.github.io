## About me
I am [PhD student](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/computer-science/phd-computer-science/phd-students/phd/42428-seyed-shayan-sajjadinia){:target="_blank"} at Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, supevised by [Prof. Bruno Carpentieri](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/computer-science/academic-staff/person/38064-bruno-carpentieri){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Gerhard A. Holzapfel](https://www.biomech.tugraz.at/){:target="_blank"}. I am also a mechanical and biomedical engineer, allowing me to carry out research on applications of computer science on these fields.

Applied computer science, especially using numerical analysis and artificial intelligence, have wide applications in engineering and medicine, e.g., [computer simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation){:target="_blank"}, [computational biomechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics#Computational_biomechanics){:target="_blank"}, [medical imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_image_computing){:target="_blank"}. 
In particular, I am interested in [finite element methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method){:target="_blank"} for physics-based and numerical modeling (typically by [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics){:target="_blank"} and [multiphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiphysics){:target="_blank"}). I also prefer [machine learning methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning){:target="_blank"} for data-driven or intelligent modeling. I believe, although these two techniques are great per se, but combination of them can be revolutionary, as they can address each other's limitaions.

## My research
In the following, a brief overview of my main academic research is presented.

### PhD dissertation (coming soon)

### MSc thesis (coming soon)


## Last updates
- I am going to present a poster at University of Bozen-Bolzano (room F6) on Monday, 12 July, 16:30-17:15.
- The list of publication and CV have now been published.
- My website is launched but still requires further improvement. I will update the other sections of this website as soon as possible.
