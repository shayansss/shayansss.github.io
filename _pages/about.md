## About me
I am a [PhD student in Computer Science](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/computer-science/phd-computer-science/phd-students/phd/42428-seyed-shayan-sajjadinia){:target="_blank"} at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, supervised by [Prof. Bruno Carpentieri](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/computer-science/academic-staff/person/38064-bruno-carpentieri){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Gerhard A. Holzapfel](https://www.biomech.tugraz.at/){:target="_blank"}. I am also a mechanical engineer and a biomedical engineer, allowing me to carry out research on the interdisciplinary areas between these fields, especially using numerical analysis and artificial intelligence that have wide applications in engineering and medicine, e.g., computer simulation, computational biomechanics, medical imaging. In this regard, on the one hand, I implement finite element methods for physics-based and numerical modeling (typically by continuum mechanics and multiphysics), and on the other hand, I deploy machine learning methods for data-driven or intelligent modeling. I believe, although these techniques are great per se, combining them can be revolutionary, as they can address each otherâ€™s limitations. Therefore, most of my recent academic research and education are devoted to them separately and their combinations.

*[computer simulation]: It referes to the simulation of the natural systems and processes using mathematical methods implemented by computers, typically by numerical methods and data-driven algorithms.
*[computational biomechanics]: Computational or numerical biomechanics is an emerging field of natural science that first assumes that biological systems have significant mechanical behaviors and then uses computational mutiphysics and mechanical engineering methods, e.g., computer-aided engineering codes and continuum biomechanics, to computationally simulate them. It has many applications in medicine, e.g., optimization of orthopedic implants, cardiovascular multiphysics studies, virtual-reality-based surgical simulators, etc.
*[medical imaging]: Medical image computing uses computer science (and related fields) to analyse the medical images. Depending on the imaging technique, it may be also relevant to physics, computational science, radiology, etc., rendering it a highly interdisciplinary area.
*[finite element methods]: These are a group of numerical methods to solve partial differntial equations, and they are highly used for computer simulation of (bio)mechanical processes.
*[multiphysics]: Multiphysics modeling focuses on coupling between different physical systems of equations, e.g., mechanochemical analysis, mixture theory, etc.
*[continuum mechanics]: It is an extremely widely-used method for physics-based modeling that uses applied mechanics, e.g., non-linear elasticity and fluid dynamics, to analytically model the mechanical (and similar) systems, with an assumption that the modeled systems are formed by continuous media. This assumption holds valid for most of the engineering calculations, and even it may still be applicable on discrete media if it can roughly be viewed as continous at some scales.
*[machine learning]: It is a subfield of artificial intelligence that automatically uses data and experience to implement a computational task. It is also widely used for data analysis and data-driven modeling, especially using deep neural networks.
