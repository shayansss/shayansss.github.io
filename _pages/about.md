## About me
I am a [PhD student at Free University of Bozen-Bolzano](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/computer-science/phd-computer-science/phd-students/phd/42428-seyed-shayan-sajjadinia){:target="_blank"} , supervised by [Prof. Bruno Carpentieri](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/computer-science/academic-staff/person/38064-bruno-carpentieri){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Gerhard A. Holzapfel](https://www.biomech.tugraz.at/){:target="_blank"}. I am also a mechanical engineer and a biomedical engineer, allowing me to carry out research on applications of computer science on these fields. Applied computer science, especially using numerical analysis and artificial intelligence, have wide applications in engineering and medicine, e.g., [computer simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation){:target="_blank"}, computational biomechanics, [medical imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_image_computing){:target="_blank"}. 
In particular, I am interested in [finite element methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method){:target="_blank"} for physics-based and numerical modeling (typically by [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics){:target="_blank"} and [multiphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiphysics){:target="_blank"}). I also prefer [machine learning methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning){:target="_blank"} for data-driven or intelligent modeling. I believe, although these two techniques are great per se, but combination of them can be revolutionary, as they can address each other's limitations. Therefore, I devote my recent academic research and education to the applications of machine learning and finite element analysis.

*[computational biomechanics]: Computational biomechanics is an emerging field of natural science that first assumes that biological system has significant mechanical behaviors and then uses engineering methods, e.g., numerical and continuum mechanics, to computationally simulate them. It has many applications in orthopedic, oncology, and cardiovascular studies, virtual-reality-based surgery simulators, etc.



## Last updates
- I am going to present a poster at Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (room F6) on Monday, 12 July, 16:30-17:15.
- The list of publication and professional experience have now been published.
- My website is launched but still requires further improvement. I will update the other sections of this website as soon as possible.
