## Commercial Code: Developing Digital Twins for Intelligent Structural Health Monitoring
  - **Duration**: Less than a year.
  - **Summary**: An ongoing project at [CAEmate](https://caemate.com/){:target="_blank"}.
  - **Technologies**: Python (PyTorch, Sklearn, Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy) and Git (on VS Code or Linux Shell).
  - **Fields**: Data science (machine learning and signal processing), applied mathematics (numerical analysis and optimization), and engineering physics (modal analysis).

## PhD Dissertation: Hybrid Machine Learning and Numerical Analysis of Cartilage Biomechanics
  - **Duration**: 4 years.
  - **Summary**: Articular cartilage (AC) is vital for pain-free movement but is subjected to significant stress, making it important to study. Traditional simulations, like finite element analysis, are slow. This study introduces a faster AI and machine learning approach to simulate AC behavior using fewer, more efficient data samples. The research presents a new model that combines advanced physics with a pre-stressing algorithm, reducing the need for extensive data. The results highlight the importance of pre-stressing and show that this method speeds up simulations while maintaining accuracy. The study also offers open-source tools, making the approach useful for broader applications. This [dissertation](https://github.com/shayansss/pmse){:target="_blank"} is written in English, corresponding to most of my published [papers](https://shayansss.github.io/publications.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [code](https://shayansss.github.io/publications.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
  - **Advisors**: Bruno Carpentieri and Gerhard A. Holzapfel
  - **Technologies**: Python (TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy, Sklearn, and Abaqus GUI scripts) and Fortran (Abaqus subroutines).
  - **Fields**: Data science (machine learning), applied mathematics (numerical analysis and optimization), and engineering physics (biomechanics).

## MSc Thesis: Computational and Biomechanical Investigation into the Degeneration of the Main Articular Cartilage Constituents in Osteoarthritis
  - **Duration**: 2 years.
  - **Summary**: Osteoarthritis is a condition where the joint cartilage and underlying bone, known as the bone-cartilage unit, undergo changes that affect their function. This study introduces a novel, more accurate computer model to simulate these changes. The model combines different techniques to better understand how osteoarthritis progresses. The research found that changes in the subchondral bone (the bone just beneath the cartilage) play a crucial role in how fluid moves through the joint, affecting the overall health of the cartilage. While minor damage to cartilage fibers does have some localized effects, it doesnâ€™t significantly impact the underlying bone. This helps us understand the important role of subchondral bone in osteoarthritis development. This [thesis](https://github.com/shayansss/pmse){:target="_blank"} is written mostly in Persian, but it is nearly the same as my first [journal paper](https://shayansss.github.io/files/2019_09_preprint.pdf){:target="_blank"} in English.
  - **Advisors**: Mohammad Haghpanahi and Mohammad Razi.
  - **Technologies**: Python (Abaqus GUI scripts) and Fortran (Abaqus subroutines).
  - **Fields**: Applied mathematics (numerical analysis) and engineering physics (biomechanics).
