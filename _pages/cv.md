## Skills
----------
* **Major hard skills**:
  * **Numerical simulation**: finite element analysis, e.g., using Abaqus and its subroutines (e.g., UMAT for implementation of advanced custom models).
  * **Machine learning**: Graph neural networks, hybrid models, feature engineering, optimization.
  * **Scientific programming**: Fortran and Python (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Keras, Scikitlearn, TensorFlow).
  * **Physics-based modeling:**: biomechanical modeling (e.g., fibril-reinforced constitutive modeling), continuum mechanics, elasticity, multiscale analysis of biomaterials, and biological multiphysics.
* **Minor hard skills**: Biomechanical tests, other coding skills (GIT, Matlab, R, C/C++, and Scala), presentation and graphical tools (LaTex, MS Office, and some of the Adobe and web development apps), and other modeling tools (FEBio, SolidWorks, 3ds Max, and Mimics).
