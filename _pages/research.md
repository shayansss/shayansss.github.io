## PhD Dissertation (Ongoing Project)
-------
  * **Title:** Advanced and efficient numerical analysis of articular cartilage by multiphysics and machine learning
  * **Other main contributors**:
      * Supervisor: [Prof. Bruno Carpentieri](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/computer-science/academic-staff/person/38064-bruno-carpentieri){:target="_blank"}
      * Co-supervisor: [Prof. Gerhard A. Holzapfel](https://www.biomech.tugraz.at/){:target="_blank"}
      * Collaborator: [Dr. Shriram Duraisamy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HtBrxbsAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}
  * **Research outcomes (so far):**
      * 2 relevant peer-reviewed publications:
          * 1 full journal paper
          * 1 full conference proceedings paper
      * 1 working paper
      * 2 international presentations
      * 2 GitHub repositories
  * **Download link:** Not available, since the work is ongoing.

## MSc Thesis
-------
  * **Title:** Computational and biomechanical investigation into the degeneration of the main articular cartilage constituents in osteoarthritis
  * **Other main contributors**:
      * Supervisor: [Prof. Mohammad Haghpanahi](http://www.iust.ac.ir/content/892/haghpanahi){:target="_blank"}
      * Advisor: [Prof. Mohammad Razi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y2XjYRkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}
  * **Research outcomes:**
      * 2 peer-reviewed journal publications:
          * 1 relevant full paper
          * 1 irrelevant short paper
      * 1 GitHub repository
  * **Download link:** The [thesis](https://shayansss.github.io/files/2017_12.pdf){:target="_blank"} is mostly written in Persian, and therefore, for English speakers, I recommend downloading instead the [relevant full journal paper](https://shayansss.github.io/files/2019_09_preprint.pdf){:target="_blank"}, as it contains most of the results.

## Other (Minor but Important) Projects
-------
The following projects have not been publicly published but can be shared specifically upon a reasonable request.
  * **Important biomechanical parameters of knee cartilage** (the MSc seminar report)
  * **Friction modeling** (as part of a contributory project in hexapod robot modeling)
  * **Bioengineering aspects of coronary stents** (an extensive report with around 200 pages)
  * **Damaged cartilage modeling using Abaqus UMAT implementation** (a technical report)
  * **Matlab for nonlinear finite element modeling** (a technical report)
  * **Modeling of a gearbox by SolidWorks** (the BSc final project)
