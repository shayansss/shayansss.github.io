## MSc Thesis
-------
  * **Title:** computational and biomechanical investigation into the degeneration of the main articular cartilage constituents in osteoarthritis
  * **Other main contributors**:
      * Supervisor: [Prof. Mohammad Haghpanahi](http://www.iust.ac.ir/content/892/haghpanahi){:target="_blank"} (Iran University of Science & Technology)
      * Advisor: [Prof. Mohammad Razi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y2XjYRkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} (Iran University of Medical Sciences)
  * **Abstract:** It has been experimentally proposed that the discrete regions of articular cartilage along with different subchondral regions, known as the bone-cartilage unit, are biomechanically altered during osteoarthritis degeneration. However, a validated computational framework capturing all of the dominant changes in multiphasic parameters has not yet been developed. In this study, a new validated finite element model is proposed which is a combination of several previously well-established nonlinear, depth-dependent, fibril-reinforced swelling finite element models in order to improve the accuracy and functionality of the simulations. Then, some simulations are conducted by means of the dominant parameters in accordance with recent research and computational implementations of unconfined compression and indentation compression tests. In addition to geometrical variations due to fibrillation and permanent split line torsion, the aforementioned dominant parameters include proteoglycan depletion, collagen fibrillar softening, permeability and fluid fraction increase for approximately non-advanced osteoarthritis. The results depict the importance of subchondral bone tissues in fluid distribution within the bone-cartilage unit by decreasing the fluid pressure and permeation during osteoarthritis. Furthermore, the osteoarthritis composition-based studies shed light on the significant biomechanical role of the calcified cartilage in stress contributions, together with fluid and osmotic pressure alterations and insignificant role of minor fibrillar abnormalities in load sharing of subchondral bone constituents. We conclude that subchondral bone discrete parts play a key role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Nevertheless, minor fibrillar abnormalities that are not in the deep zone of articular cartilage have a regional degenerative effect, although a negligible influence on the subchondral bone tissues.
  * **Research outcomes:**
      * 2 peer-reviewed journal publications:
          * 1 relevant full paper
          * 1 irrelevant short paper
      * 1 GitHub repository
  * **Download link:** The [thesis](https://shayansss.github.io/files/2017_12.pdf){:target="_blank"} is mostly written in Persian, and therefore, for English speakers, I recommend downloading instead the [relevant full journal paper](https://shayansss.github.io/files/2019_09_preprint.pdf){:target="_blank"}, as it contains most of the results.
