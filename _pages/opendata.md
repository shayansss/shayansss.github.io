- [Fortran UMAT, FLOW, and SDVINI subroutines for a multiphysics and fibril-reinforced model of articular cartilage](https://github.com/shayansss/msc){:target="_blank"}: This code is the Fortran 77 version of the UMAT, FLOW, and SDVINI subroutines of the cartilage model, I firstly proposed in my Master's thesis. The model with minor modification was used in several publications.
